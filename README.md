# Directory

A copy of all Rebrickable API and download data. This data is used by other systems such as [colours-v2](https://github.com/BrickMMO/colours-v2) and [parts-v1](https://github.com/BrickMMO/parts-v1).

There is no frontend for this system. These PHP import scripts will run from the BrickMMO server using cron jobs.

## Project Stack

This application will intentionally be written in a simplified structure with a simple stack. This will provide BrickMMO developers with a simple application to contribute to once they have some understanding of server-side languages such as PHP.
